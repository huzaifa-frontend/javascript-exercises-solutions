# 📘 JavaScript Exercises Solution

📁 **Chapter-Wise Solutions for JavaScript Practice**

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains my personal solutions to JavaScript exercises from various chapters. Each chapter folder includes:

- 📝 A **PDF file** with exercise questions
- 📂 A **`task/` folder** containing solution files for each exercise
- 📚 Chapters may be named as single numbers (`01`, `02`, etc.) or ranges (`06-08`) based on the content groupings.

These tasks are part of my learning journey to improve JavaScript fundamentals through consistent practice and organization.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- HTML (for test cases if required)
- PDF format (for questions)
- VS Code (for writing and testing code)

## 🚀 How to Use

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/huzaifa-frontend/javascript-exercises-solutions.git

3. Open the `.js` files in your code editor or run them in the browser/console for testing.
